What's a Cryptoparty?
=====================

* Worldwide, decentralized movement to try to demystify cryptography and digital privacy

----

Expectations
============
* Be nice to each other
* No feigned astonishment
* Save "well actually" discussion for after/privately

Chatham House Rule
------------------

* 'Participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed. The Rule is more about the dissemination of the information after the event - nothing should be done to identify, either explicitly or implicitly, who said what.'
* If you're tweeting things or taking pictures, do not identify people


----

Privacy
=======
"Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world." (Eric Hughes)

----

Anonymity
=========
* Without anonymity, online privacy is impossible
* We create digital trails of data as we move through the physical and virtual world which reveal us without our consent

----

Threat Modeling
===============

* What information do I want to keep secret?
* From whom?
* What do I have to lose if it gets out?
